## Project Introduction
This project includes four tile sets of geographic phenomena. 
- [Access the Web Map](https://eeckey.github.io/TileGeneration/)

## Tile Set Layers
### Tile Set 1: Modified Basemap
![Tile 1](/img/basemap.png "Tile 1") 
- Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
- Available zoom layers: Min - 8; Max - 10.
- Description of tile set: Modified the basemap with font changes to Helvetica and size. 

### Tile Set 2: Thematic Layer of Seattle Public Art

- Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
- Available zoom layers: Min - 8; Max - 10
- Description of tile set: Thematic layer made by my own geospatial dataset of public art locations in the Seattle area. The public art includes - sculptures, photographs, paintings, and various installations but diferent artists.

### Tile Set 3

- Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
- Available zoom layers: Min - 8; Max - 10
- Description of tile set: Layer group that is composed of a thematic layer of Seattle publicart from tile set 2 and a basemap from tile set 1.

### Tile Set 4

Examined geographic area: Seattle, WA [-122.2559435, 47.6002614] and surrounding area
Available zoom layers: Min - 8; Max - 10
Description of tile set: Map layer designed over Mapbox. It embodies a map theme relevant to my research interests of the environment. Te map uses the color, icon, and label to realize the theme.

## Data Sources
I exporteda CSV format of [Seattle Public Art Data](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Public-Art-Data/j7sn-tdzk/data) from [Seattle Open Data](https://data.seattle.gov/). I then used QGIS to create a shapefile from the CSV and save the points of each public art location in Seattle.
